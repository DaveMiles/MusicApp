/*
Your task is to develop a basic Java console application that will emulate the main features of a music
streaming service such as Spotify or Apple Music. 
You should code a basic application that is able to store a list of song objects. Each song object should be
able to store the artistâ€™s name, the song title, and the current number of times the song has been played.
Your application should have the following features:
1. Add a new song to the list of songs
2. Remove a song from the list of songs
3. Print a list of all the songs stored
4. Print a list of songs over a given number of plays
